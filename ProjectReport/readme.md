Abstract:
	Now-a-days digital games are part of life and very handy. Many people just pass their time playing these digital games in various devices like mobile phone, iPad, tablets, laptops etc., However, we have different level of games based on age, gender etc., criteria. Coming to this project, it’s a basic game where the player controls a ball to move on a specified path to reach the end point or destination. While reaching the end point, player will have few targets (here coins) to make this game more interesting. Ball can jump, move – forward, backward, left and right and can collect coins.

Game Flow:
1. Player need to click START button to enter into the game.
2. Then, ball can be moved using various keys as follows:
Feature	Keys
Forward	Up Arrow
Backward	Down Arrow
Left	Left Arrow
Right	Right Arrow
Jump	Space Bar
3. Using the above keys, player need to move on the path specified and collect all the coins in the scene.
4. Score keeps incrementing while collecting all the coins and there will be 11 coins the scene to collect.
5. When player collects all the 11 coins successfully, it displays a message “Congratulations…..!!! You have successfully completed the game.” 

Project Flow:
Menu Scene: 
	Game starts with menu scene where it consists of a START button. Player needs to click this start button to begin the game.
Main Scene:
	After clicking the START button in Main Scene, the game scene transfers to Main Scene where all the game play happens.
End Scene:
	After successful collection of coins, Main Scene will be redirected to End Scene where the game ends. 
* All these scene transfers happens with the help of UnityEngine.SceneManagement
Learning Outcomes:
	1.To Scale GameObjects in Unity
	2.To add colors to 3D game objects
	3.To create prefabs and accessing their properties.
	4.To create and programming the scripts
	5.To move, rotate, jump GameObjects 
	6.To make camera follow the GameObjects.
	7.To add components like direction light, audio source
	8.To add audio, sound effects in the game.
	9.To create canvas, background, textures, UI text properties etc.,
	10.To change or transfer game scenes 

Future Work:
This game can be developed further with extra levels, powers to the ball and it can also be build to deploy in AppStore and PlayStore.
